			<p>Hypothesis: If a restaurant in Onondaga County receives more than one critical violation, they will close within the next year. I got my information from the <a href= "https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Onondaga-County-Restaurant-Inspections/tbxv-5tbd/data_preview" target="_blank">New York Health Data website</a> and I think itâ€™s newsworthy because people would be interested to know if restaurants they enjoy actually close or change their practices after critical violations.

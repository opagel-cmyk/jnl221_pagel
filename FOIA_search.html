			<p>I was researching the salaries of school teachers in the city of Syracuse. On Muckrock, I found a record that contained teacherâ€™s salaries, their positions, the length of their employment, their contract length, and many other factors. It was requested by Evergreen Solutions, an organization that works to benefit K-12 teachers. Their request was met with a long chart containing lots of information. I was interested in the difference of pay between various positions and schools.

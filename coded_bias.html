			<p>I was surprised by discriminatory AI can be. It’s been discovered that AI is best at detecting white male faces because they are the most common in the databases that it gets its information from. A quote that stood out to me was, “Everybody has unconscious biases and people imbed their own biases into technology.” I always thought of technology and math as unbiased because they’re made up of numbers and formulas, but AI can be very biased. This can be very harmful to people of color especially when facial recognition technology is used by the police because it can be very inaccurate when it comes to POC. 
</p>
		<p>In pop culture, AI is often depicted as robots with personalities and their own thoughts and emotions. A lot of the time, they’re evil and fight against humans. However in reality, AI is math. It’s made up of formulas and algorithms and only knows what programs teach it to know. It can’t have a personality like it often does in movies and TV.
</p>
     	<p>AI technology is not refined enough to be implemented into the world because it can cause physical and psychological harm to people. 

How are people being harmed by AI technology?

What technological advancements need to be achieved before AI is fully safe to be out in the world?

			<p>Public dataset #1</p>
<p>Link:https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Rat-Sightings/3q43-55fe/data_preview </p>
<p>How is this data organized and collected?</p>
<p>The data has been collected through 311 service requests in New York City regarding incidents with rats and rat sightings. </p>
<p>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</p>
<p>It could be newsworthy if the number of rats was drastically increasing or decreasing because it could reflect environmental factors. They could also be interfering with people’s lives in New York City if the population is becoming too large. A good audience for this story would be people living in NYC because they’re affected by this issue. </p>
<p>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</p>
<p>There are more rat sightings in Brooklyn than in other places in New York City.

<p>How is this data organized and collected?</p>
<p>Encyclopedia Titanica received a list of all of the Titanic passengers from Mike Findlay, the former president of the Titanic International Society.  </p>
<p>Why is this newsworthy? Who would be a good audience for a story on this?</p>
<p>This is newsworthy because it’s one of the biggest resources about the passengers of the Titanic. The researchers at this website are continuously gaining more information about the people and constantly update the data when they find new things. They are making biographies about every passenger and the data is very interesting and constantly changing. 
 </p>
<p>What is one data hypothesis you could make about this dataset?</p>
<p>TMore third class passengers died in the Titanic than passengers of other classes.
